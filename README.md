- Populate geographahical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library
- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls
- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps
- Each earthquake will be represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color
- Each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and location
